 Untitled multiplayer FPS project written in Godot

For view on the current status of the project take a look at the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/EK1AWbzX/f02336476388189d37d5431b0bcced69/untitled-fps):

If you're wanting to run this you'll have to do a couple of things:
1. Copy this git repo
2. Install Godot
3. Point Godot to the local repo folder
4. "Edit" the project

If you want to run two local multiplayer instances to test it out:
1. Hit f5 on the open project to run the first screen
2. Open ANOTHER Godot project space
3. Select "Run" instead of "Edit" in order to run another instance

Controls:
W, A, S, D (up, down, left, right) = movement
Mouse = camera
Spacebar = jump
